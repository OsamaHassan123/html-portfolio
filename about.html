<h1>PROJECTS </h1>
<h2>Traffic Sign Recognition using CNN</h2>
<ul>
<li> Used Traffic c Sign German Dataset and classified based on the image signs,
achieving 95% accuracy.</li>
<li> Transformed the original image to a grayscale image using Opencv.</li>
<li> Used Convolutional Neural Network with fixed and learnable layers for detection
and recognition.</li>
<li>Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Tensorflow, Keras</li>
<h2>Image Cartoonizer</h2>
<li>Transformed original image to a grayscale image and smoothened it using Blur</li>
function.
<li>Retrieved edges and highlighted them using Adaptive Threshold Technique.</li>
<li>Used BilateralFilter for creating a light mask of original image without noise.</li>
<li>Performed Bitwise AND on mask and edged image to create a cartoonized image.</li>
<li>Tools Used: Python, Pandas, OpenCV</li>
</ul>
